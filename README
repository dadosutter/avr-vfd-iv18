   This is a hardware and software project to control russian IV-18 VFD tubes.
   It was initially done using eLua (http://www.eluaproject.net), thus making
the code generic to all supported platforms. The original project can be
seen at the eLua User Labs at http://wiki.eluaproject.net/eLuaVFD
   Felipe Maimon designed this AVR-based controller board and firmware, to
allow a simple serial (5Vcc UART) API to control the tubes.
   The board has it's own programmable switching power supply, filament regulated voltage and
segment multiplexing software. 
   Some basic scroll facilities are also included.
   The API and board's functionality can be greatly (and easially) improved.
   Hardware is also open source and is included on the doc.

Makefile have the following commands:
	make
	make clean
	make program
