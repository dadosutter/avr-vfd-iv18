   This is a hardware and software project to control russian IV-18 VFD tubes.
It was initially done using eLua (http://www.eluaproject.net), thus making
the code generic to all supported platforms.
   Felipe Maimon designed an AVR-based controller board and firmware, to
allow a simple serial (5Vcc UART) API to control the tubes.
   The board has it's own programmable switching power supply, filament regulated voltage and
segment multiplexing software. 
   Some basic scroll facilities are also included.
   The API and board's functionality can be greatly (and easially) improved.
   Hardware is also open source and is included on the doc.
